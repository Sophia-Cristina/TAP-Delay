This delay is made from "The Audio Programmer" tutorial!

It is an awesome channel!

This delay is working now!
When i learn how to do the feedback from "The Audio Programmer", i'll edit this again!
Thanks for @Rob2k of the TAP community for figuring out the problem! :p

Later i'll add a modulation method to do a delay i used in some musics but i never saw someone making it!
